LCPC16 Submission Experiments
=============================

This is a repository containing all the artifacts and code versions we used to
perform the evaluation section for the LCPC16 submission. In addition to the
experiments mentioned in the paper, it contains experiments that were not
discussed either because they turned out to be only tangentially relevant to
our work, or we did not have the space in the paper. In addition, in this
README and others in sub-directories, we explain in more details some of our
choices in the experiment design. By making all of of the experiments publicly
available as well as explaining in more details our experiment design, we aim
to make our research more reproducible and easier to build upon for future work
by our own or other researchers.

The repository follows the Wu Wei conventions and is compatible with its
commandline tools (https://github.com/Sable/wu-wei-benchmarking-toolkit/).

Each benchmark has multiple implementations that were either created by hand or
automatically using the Mc2Mc tool (https://github.com/Sable/Mc2Mc). Each
benchmark has its own README that explains the results we obtained for the
different versions and the interpretation we made of the different results.
